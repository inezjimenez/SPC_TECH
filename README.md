# Juntas Brillamos: Participant Survey

This QR code has been generated for the purpose of gathering individual feedback from all participants involved with Juntas Brillamos. Each activity will receive a rating, and we kindly request personal feedback. By accumulating data from these young Latina participants, we aim to better address their concerns and tailor our program to their needs.

## User Story

```
AS A participant
I WANT to leave feedback on my experience during the weekend

```

## Employee Story

```
AS employees with access to sensitive data
WE WANT to generate feedback from the young ladies about their experience with us
SO THAT WE can create a better, stronger experience with Juntas Brillamos
```

## Criteria 
* Need a phone with a QR reader
* If you do not have a QR reader, we may use this URL https://qrfy.com/p/n0dyCh6FYP

## Functionality
To provide feedback, participants can scan the QR code using their mobile phones and patiently await the website to load. Upon loading, two distinct cards will appear, one labeled 'Activities' and the other 'Comments.' If they choose 'Activities,' participants can select the activity they wish to rate and provide comments. They have the option to repeat this process for additional activities. Finally, they can enter their email and phone number and click 'Send' to submit their feedback.

Alternatively, if they opt for 'Comments,' they will click on the '+' sign to rate their experience and leave a comment. Upon completion, they can proceed to click 'Send Feedback' and, similar to the 'Activities' option, enter their email and phone number before clicking 'Send.' Once these steps are completed, participants will have successfully filled out our survey.
