# Juntas Brillamos: Participant Survey

This QR code was created to collect personal feedback from all participants at Juntas Brillamos. With the data collected from these young Latinas, we will be able to help address more concerns and make our program the best.

## User Story

I WANT to leave feedback on my experience during the weekend
SO THAT I can come back and have more fun
```

## Employee Story

```
AS employees with access to sensitive data
WE WANT to generate feedback from the young ladies about their experience with us
SO THAT WE can create a better, stronger experience with Juntas Brillamos
```

## Criteria

If you click on Activities, then you may select which activities you enjoyed the most. If you click on Comments, then you will click on the + sign, rate your experience, and write a comment. When you are done writing, click Send Feedback. Enter your email and phone number at the end and click send. After all of that, you are done filling out our survey.
